# Speech Sounds Fun Practice
Articulation Teletherapy


Full Stack Group Project 1 created during KU Coding Bootcamp. The user may click on the group of sounds from the menu to work on then click through the carousel of animals. Once an animal is clicked, a Gif, viseme (mouth representation of the sound), and a prompt to repeat the text-to-speech will appear.
